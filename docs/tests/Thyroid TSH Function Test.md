## What This Test Measures
The Thyroid TSH Function Test measures the level of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in your blood.  
- TSH is produced by the pituitary gland and regulates thyroid hormone production (T4 and T3).  
- Abnormal TSH levels can indicate an underactive or overactive thyroid, even before symptoms appear.
