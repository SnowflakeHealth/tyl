## What This Test Measures
The Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) Test measures the percentage of hemoglobin proteins in your blood that are coated with sugar (glycated). Because red blood cells live for about 3 months, the HbA1c reflects your average blood sugar over the past 2â€“3 months. This makes it a key test for diagnosing and monitoring diabetes and prediabetes.
