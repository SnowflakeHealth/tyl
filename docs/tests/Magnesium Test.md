## What This Test Measures
The Magnesium Test measures the concentration of magnesium in your blood.  
- **Magnesium** is an essential mineral that supports muscle contraction, nerve signaling, energy production, and bone health.  
- Low magnesium (hypomagnesemia) can cause muscle cramps, irregular heartbeat, and neurological symptoms.  
- High magnesium (hypermagnesemia) is less common but may occur with kidney problems or excessive supplementation.
