## What This Test Measures
The Adiponectin Test measures the level of adiponectin â€” a protein hormone produced by fat cells (adipocytes) that plays a key role in regulating glucose and lipid metabolism. Higher adiponectin levels are generally linked to improved insulin sensitivity and a reduced risk of metabolic disorders. Lower levels may indicate an increased risk for conditions such as type 2 diabetes, obesity-related complications, and cardiovascular disease.

## Understanding Your Results
| **Adiponectin Level** | **What It May Mean** |
|----------------------|-----------------------|
| Low                  | May suggest insulin resistance, increased risk for type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome |
| Normal               | Indicates healthy adiponectin function and typical metabolic profile |
| High                 | Often linked to improved insulin sensitivity and lower cardiovascular risk |

*Note: Reference ranges vary; results should be interpreted by a healthcare provider in context of overall health.*
