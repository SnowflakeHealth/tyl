## What This Test Measures
The Testosterone Test measures the amount of testosterone in your blood.  
- **Testosterone** is the primary male sex hormone, produced mainly in the testes, and plays a critical role in muscle mass, bone density, red blood cell production, and libido.  
- Women also produce testosterone in smaller amounts, and testing may be used in certain female health evaluations.

## Why Take This Test / Who Should Take It
You may benefit from this test if you:
- Have symptoms of low testosterone (fatigue, low libido, decreased muscle mass)
- Have symptoms of excess testosterone (acne, hair loss, aggression, infertility)
- Are being evaluated for reproductive or sexual health issues
- Are undergoing testosterone replacement therapy and need monitoring
- Have certain chronic conditions (e.g., diabetes, obesity) that may affect hormone levels
