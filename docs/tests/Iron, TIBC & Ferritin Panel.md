## What This Test Measures
This panel includes:
- **Serum Iron** â€” Measures circulating iron in the blood  
- **Ferritin** â€” Indicates stored iron in the body  
- **Total Iron-Binding Capacity (TIBC)** â€” Measures the bloodâ€™s capacity to transport iron  
- **Transferrin Saturation** â€” Calculated value showing the percentage of iron-binding sites occupied

---

## Why Take This Test / Who Should Take It
You may benefit from this test if you:
- Have symptoms of iron deficiency (fatigue, weakness, pale skin)
- Have symptoms of iron overload (joint pain, abdominal pain, fatigue)
- Have chronic conditions affecting iron balance (e.g., anemia, liver disease)
- Are undergoing treatment for iron-related disorders
- Are pregnant or planning pregnancy

---

## How to Prepare
- Fast for 8â€“12 hours before your appointment (water only)  
- Avoid iron supplements for at least 24 hours before testing unless otherwise directed

## Understanding Your Results
- **Low Iron & Low Ferritin** â€” Suggestive of iron deficiency anemia  
- **High Iron & High Ferritin** â€” May indicate iron overload (hemochromatosis) or inflammation  
- **Low Ferritin with Normal Iron** â€” Possible early iron deficiency  
- **High TIBC** â€” Common in iron deficiency  
- **Low TIBC** â€” May occur in chronic illness or iron overload

## Related Tests
Often ordered with:
- [Complete Blood Count (CBC)] â€” Detects anemia and other blood disorders  
- [Vitamin B12 & Folate Test] â€” Assesses other common causes of anemia  
- [Liver Function Tests] â€” Evaluate potential effects of iron overload

Alternative tests:
- [Ferritin Test Only] â€” Isolates stored iron measurement  
- [Transferrin Test] â€” Focused on iron transport protein

## FAQ (Schema-Ready)
**Do I need to fast for the Iron, TIBC & Ferritin Panel?**  
Yes, fasting for 8â€“12 hours is recommended.

**Can supplements affect my results?**  
Yes â€” iron supplements can temporarily raise serum iron; follow your providerâ€™s guidance.

**Can this test detect anemia?**  
It helps identify iron-deficiency anemia and other iron-related disorders but is often combined with a CBC.

**What is TIBC?**  
Total Iron-Binding Capacity measures the bloodâ€™s ability to transport iron, reflecting transferrin protein levels.
