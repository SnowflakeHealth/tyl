## What This Test Measures
The Gout (Uric Acid) Test measures the concentration of uric acid in your blood.  
- **High uric acid levels** can lead to the formation of urate crystals in joints, causing gout, a form of inflammatory arthritis.  
- Elevated levels can also be associated with kidney stones and other kidney-related conditions.  
- **Low uric acid levels** may occur in certain liver diseases, kidney disorders, or with specific medications.
