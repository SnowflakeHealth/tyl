## Quick Facts
| **Test Type**         | Blood test |
|----------------------|------------|
| **Fasting Required** | No (but may be ordered with a fasting lipid panel) |

## What This Test Measures
The Lipoprotein(a) Test measures the amount of Lp(a) in your blood. Lp(a) is a type of LDL (‚Äúbad‚Äù) cholesterol particle with an added protein, apolipoprotein(a), that increases the risk of plaque buildup in arteries.  
- **Elevated Lp(a)** levels are largely determined by genetics and can significantly increase cardiovascular and stroke risk.
- Unlike standard cholesterol measures, Lp(a) is not substantially changed by diet or exercise.

## Why Take This Test / Who Should Take It
You may benefit from this test if you:
- Have a family history of premature heart disease or stroke
- Have high cholesterol that is difficult to control
- Have had a heart attack or stroke despite normal cholesterol levels
- Want to identify inherited cardiovascular risk factors

---

## How to Prepare
- No fasting required unless ordered alongside a lipid panel  
- Continue medications unless otherwise instructed by your provider

## Understanding Your Results
- **Normal Lp(a)** ‚Äî Below the lab-specific reference threshold (commonly < 30 mg/dL or < 75 nmol/L)  
- **High Lp(a)** ‚Äî Above the threshold; associated with greater cardiovascular risk

*Note: Units and reference ranges vary between labs ‚Äî always review results with a healthcare provider.*

## FAQ (Schema-Ready)
**Do I need to fast for an Lp(a) test?**  
Not necessarily, but if combined with a lipid panel, fasting for 8‚Äì12 hours may be recommended.

**Can lifestyle changes lower Lp(a)?**  
Diet and exercise have little impact; Lp(a) levels are largely genetic.

**Why test for Lp(a) if my cholesterol is normal?**  
Elevated Lp(a) can increase cardiovascular risk even when other cholesterol levels are normal.

**Is there treatment for high Lp(a)?**  
Currently, targeted therapies are in development; other cardiovascular risk factors should be aggressively managed.
