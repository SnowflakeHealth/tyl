## What This Test Measures
The Advanced Heart Health Test Panel (with ApoB) evaluates both traditional and advanced lipid biomarkers to give a more complete picture of heart disease risk. It typically includes:
- **Lipid Panel** â€” Total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and triglycerides
- **Apolipoprotein B (ApoB)** â€” Number of atherogenic lipoprotein particles
- **Non-HDL Cholesterol** â€” Cholesterol carried in potentially harmful particles
- **Other Advanced Markers** â€” May include LDL particle size or Lp(a) depending on lab configuration

ApoB is considered a stronger predictor of cardiovascular events than LDL cholesterol alone.

## Why Take This Test / Who Should Take It
You may benefit from this test if you:
- Have a family history of premature heart disease
- Have elevated cholesterol but unclear cardiovascular risk
- Have metabolic syndrome, diabetes, or other risk factors
- Want a more accurate assessment than a standard lipid panel provides
- Are monitoring the effects of lipid-lowering therapy

---

## How to Prepare
- Fast for 8â€“12 hours before your appointment; only water is allowed  
- Avoid alcohol and high-fat meals for 24 hours before testing  
- Follow your providerâ€™s instructions regarding medications

## Understanding Your Results
Your report may include:
- **ApoB** â€” Higher levels indicate more atherogenic particles and greater CVD risk  
- **LDL & HDL Cholesterol** â€” Standard cholesterol markers  
- **Non-HDL Cholesterol** â€” All potentially harmful cholesterol combined  
- **Advanced Lipid Markers** â€” May reveal particle size or number patterns

*Note: All results should be interpreted by a qualified healthcare provider.*

## Related Tests
Often ordered with:
- [hs-CRP] â€” Measures inflammation linked to cardiovascular events  
- [Lipoprotein(a) Test] â€” Assesses inherited risk factor for CVD  
- [Metabolic Risk Test Panel] â€” Evaluates broader metabolic syndrome risk

Alternative tests:
- [Cholesterol (Lipid) Panel] â€” Standard lipid evaluation  
- [High-Risk Heart Health Lipid and Lp(a) Test Panel] â€” Similar advanced assessment with Lp(a) focus

## FAQ (Schema-Ready)
**Do I need to fast for the Advanced Heart Health Test Panel?**  
Yes, fasting for 8â€“12 hours is required.

**What is ApoB and why is it important?**  
ApoB measures the number of atherogenic particles, which is a strong predictor of cardiovascular events.

**How is this different from a standard cholesterol test?**  
It includes advanced markers like ApoB, providing a more precise risk assessment.

**Who should consider advanced lipid testing?**  
Anyone with intermediate or high risk for CVD, or those seeking a deeper understanding of their lipid profile.
