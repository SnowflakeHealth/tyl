## What This Test Measures
The Zinc Test measures the concentration of zinc in your blood.  
- **Zinc** is an essential trace mineral involved in immune function, protein synthesis, wound healing, taste, smell, and reproductive health.  
- Deficiency can lead to impaired immunity, delayed wound healing, hair loss, and growth retardation in children.  
- Excess zinc can cause nausea, vomiting, immune suppression, and interfere with copper absorption.
