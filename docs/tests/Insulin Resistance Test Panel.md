## Quick Facts
| **Test Type**         | Blood test |
|----------------------|------------|
| **Fasting Required** | Yes (8â€“12 hours) |

## What This Test Measures
The Insulin Resistance Test Panel evaluates your body's ability to regulate blood sugar and respond to insulin. It typically includes:
- **Fasting Glucose** â€” Current blood sugar level after an overnight fast
- **Fasting Insulin** â€” Measures how much insulin your pancreas is producing at rest
- **HOMA-IR Calculation** â€” Estimates insulin resistance by combining glucose and insulin results

These results can help detect insulin resistance, which often develops before prediabetes or type 2 diabetes.

- Have risk factors for type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome
- Are overweight, especially with abdominal fat

## Understanding Your Results
**Fasting Glucose**
| **Result** | **What It May Mean** |
|------------|----------------------|
| < 100 mg/dL | Normal |
| 100â€“125 mg/dL | Prediabetes |
| â‰¥ 126 mg/dL | Diabetes (requires confirmation) |

**Fasting Insulin**
- High levels can indicate insulin resistance or early pancreatic strain  
- Low levels may suggest other endocrine issues

**HOMA-IR**
- A higher score indicates greater insulin resistance risk

*Note: Interpretation should be done by a healthcare provider.*
