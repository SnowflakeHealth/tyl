## What This Test Measures
The Iodine Test measures the amount of iodine excreted in your urine.  
- **Iodine** is essential for the production of thyroid hormones, which regulate metabolism, growth, and development.  
- Low iodine levels can cause goiter, hypothyroidism, and developmental issues.  
- High iodine levels may also cause thyroid dysfunction.
