## What This Test Measures
The Prothrombin Time (PT) with INR Test measures:
- **Prothrombin Time (PT)** â€” The number of seconds it takes your blood to clot
- **International Normalized Ratio (INR)** â€” A standardized way of expressing PT to allow comparison between labs

These tests help detect clotting disorders and monitor patients on anticoagulant medications such as warfarin.

## Why Take This Test / Who Should Take It
You may benefit from this test if you:
- Are taking warfarin or other anticoagulants and need regular monitoring
- Have unexplained bleeding or bruising
- Have liver disease, vitamin K deficiency, or other conditions affecting clotting
- Are being screened before surgery

---

## How to Prepare
- No fasting required  
- Inform your provider of all medications and supplements you are taking, especially blood thinners  
- Follow your providerâ€™s guidance on timing of your test in relation to medication doses

2. **Visit a Lab** â€” Provide a blood sample at a Quest Diagnostics location  
3. **Get Results** â€” Doctor-reviewed results in 1â€“2 business days

## Understanding Your Results
- **Normal PT/INR** â€” Indicates normal clotting function  
- **Prolonged PT/High INR** â€” May indicate blood-thinner effect, liver disease, vitamin K deficiency, or clotting factor deficiencies  
- **Shortened PT/Low INR** â€” Rare; may indicate increased clotting tendency

*Therapeutic INR range for most warfarin patients is typically 2.0â€“3.0, but target ranges vary.*

- [Complete Blood Count (CBC)] â€” Evaluates overall blood health  
- [Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT)] â€” Measures another clotting pathway  
- [Liver Function Tests] â€” Assess liverâ€™s role in producing clotting factors

## FAQ (Schema-Ready)
**Do I need to fast for a PT/INR test?**  
No, fasting is not required.

**How often should I check my INR on warfarin?**  
Frequency depends on your stability, but often every 1â€“4 weeks.

**Can diet affect my INR?**  
Yes â€” foods high in vitamin K (like leafy greens) can lower INR; consistency is key.

**Why is INR important?**  
It standardizes PT results across labs, ensuring accurate anticoagulation management.
