## What This Test Measures
The Advanced Fatty Liver Disease Test Panel uses a combination of liver-related and metabolic biomarkers to evaluate:
- **Liver Enzymes** â€” ALT, AST, GGT for liver cell injury
- **Fibrosis Markers** â€” Indicators of liver scarring progression
- **Metabolic Markers** â€” Glucose, lipids, and other relevant labs
- **Inflammation Markers** â€” hs-CRP or similar to detect ongoing liver inflammation

This test is designed to help identify patients at higher risk for progression from simple steatosis to MASH (inflammatory stage) and advanced fibrosis.

## Why Take This Test / Who Should Take It
You may benefit from this test if you:
- Have risk factors for MASLD/MASH such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, or metabolic syndrome
- Have elevated liver enzymes without a clear cause
- Have been diagnosed with fatty liver disease and want to assess progression risk
- Want a baseline before starting treatment or lifestyle changes
- Have a family history of liver disease

---

## How to Prepare
- Fast for 8â€“12 hours before your appointment; only water is allowed  
- Avoid alcohol for at least 48 hours prior to the test

- **Elevated Enzymes** â€” May indicate liver inflammation or damage
- **High Fibrosis Markers** â€” Suggest increased risk of advanced scarring
- **Metabolic Risk Factors** â€” May show associated cardiovascular or diabetes risk

*Note: Results should be interpreted by a healthcare provider in the context of imaging and clinical history.*
