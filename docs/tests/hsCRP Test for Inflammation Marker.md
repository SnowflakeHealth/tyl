## Quick Facts
| **Test Type**         | Blood test |
|----------------------|------------|
| **Fasting Required** | No |
| **Sample Type**      | Blood draw |
| **Turnaround Time**  | 1â€“2 business days |
| **Also Known As**    | High-Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein Test, hs-CRP |

---

## What This Test Measures
The hsCRP test measures C-reactive protein, a substance produced by the liver in response to inflammation. Unlike standard CRP tests, the high-sensitivity version can detect lower levels of CRP, which may indicate chronic, low-grade inflammation associated with a higher risk of heart attack and stroke.

## Why Take This Test / Who Should Take It
You may benefit from this test if you:
- Have intermediate cardiovascular risk and want additional risk stratification
- Have metabolic syndrome, diabetes, or other chronic health conditions
- Want to monitor inflammation levels over time
- Have a family history of premature heart disease

---

## How to Prepare
- No fasting required  
- Continue medications unless your healthcare provider advises otherwise

## How It Works
1. **Order Online** â€” Purchase your test securely  
2. **Visit a Lab** â€” Provide a blood sample at a Quest Diagnostics location  
3. **Get Results** â€” Secure, doctor-reviewed results within 1â€“2 business days

## Understanding Your Results
| **hsCRP Level (mg/L)** | **Risk Category** |
|------------------------|-------------------|
| < 1.0                  | Low risk          |
| 1.0â€“3.0                | Average risk      |
| > 3.0                  | High risk         |

*Note: Elevated hsCRP can be caused by infections, injuries, and other inflammatory conditions â€” not just heart disease risk.*

No, fasting is not required.

**What can cause high hsCRP levels?**  
Chronic inflammation, infections, injuries, autoimmune diseases, and cardiovascular risk factors.

**How is hsCRP used in heart health assessment?**  
It helps refine cardiovascular risk when used alongside cholesterol and other tests.

**Should hsCRP be tested regularly?**  
If you have known risk factors or elevated previous results, your provider may recommend periodic testing.
