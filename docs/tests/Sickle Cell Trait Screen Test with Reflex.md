## What This Test Measures
This screening test looks for the presence of hemoglobin S, the abnormal form of hemoglobin associated with sickle cell trait and sickle cell disease.  
- **If positive**, reflex testing (such as hemoglobin electrophoresis) is automatically performed to confirm the result and differentiate between sickle cell trait and disease.
