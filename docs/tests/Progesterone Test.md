## What This Test Measures
The Progesterone Test measures the amount of progesterone in your blood.  
- Progesterone is a hormone produced by the ovaries after ovulation and is essential for preparing the uterus for pregnancy.  
- Levels rise during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, peaking about 7 days after ovulation (often around day 21 in a typical 28-day cycle).
