## What This Test Measures
The AMH Marker Test measures the level of Anti-MÃ¼llerian Hormone in your blood.  
- AMH is produced by the granulosa cells of ovarian follicles and reflects the number of remaining eggs (ovarian reserve).  
- Unlike some other hormone tests, AMH levels are relatively stable throughout the menstrual cycle, making it a convenient marker for fertility assessment.

## Understanding Your Results
- **High AMH** â€” May indicate a high ovarian reserve; very high levels could suggest polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)  
- **Normal AMH** â€” Indicates a typical ovarian reserve for your age  
- **Low AMH** â€” Suggests a lower ovarian reserve; may impact fertility planning

*Note: AMH results should be interpreted in context with other fertility tests and medical history.*

## FAQ (Schema-Ready)
**Do I need to take the AMH test on a specific day of my cycle?**  
No, AMH levels remain stable throughout the cycle.

**Can AMH levels predict pregnancy success?**  
AMH provides information about egg quantity, but not egg quality or pregnancy likelihood.

**Does birth control affect AMH levels?**  
Some studies suggest a slight effect, but results are generally still useful.

**Is AMH testing only for women?**  
No â€” in rare cases, AMH can also be measured in men for certain medical evaluations.
