## What This Test Measures
The Homocysteine Test measures the amount of homocysteine in your blood. Elevated levels of this amino acid can be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, blood clots, and stroke. High levels may also indicate deficiencies in vitamins such as folate, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12, which are involved in homocysteine metabolism.
