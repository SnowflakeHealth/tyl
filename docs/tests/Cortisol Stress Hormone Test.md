## What This Test Measures
The Cortisol Stress Hormone Test measures the amount of cortisol in your blood.  
- **Cortisol** is a steroid hormone produced by the adrenal glands and is involved in regulating metabolism, immune response, and the bodyâ€™s stress response.  
- Levels naturally fluctuate during the day, typically peaking in the early morning and declining throughout the day.
