## What This Test Measures
This test involves two steps:
1. **Hepatitis C Antibody Test** â€” Detects antibodies your immune system produces in response to HCV infection, indicating current or past infection.  
2. **HCV RNA Test (Confirmation)** â€” If antibodies are detected, this reflex test confirms whether the virus is currently present in your bloodstream, indicating an active infection.
