## Understanding Your Results
*Typical interpretation (your provider may set personalized goals):*

**Total Cholesterol (mg/dL)**  
| **Result** | **Meaning** |
|---|---|
| < 200 | Desirable |
| 200‚Äì239 | Borderline high |
| ‚â• 240 | High |

**LDL Cholesterol (mg/dL)**  
| **Result** | **Meaning** |
|---|---|
| < 100 | Optimal |
| 100‚Äì129 | Near/above optimal |
| 130‚Äì159 | Borderline high |
| 160‚Äì189 | High |
| ‚â• 190 | Very high |

**HDL Cholesterol (mg/dL)**  
| **Result** | **Meaning** |
|---|---|
| < 40 (men), < 50 (women) | Low (higher risk) |
| ‚â• 60 | High (protective) |

**Triglycerides (mg/dL)**  
| **Result** | **Meaning** |
|---|---|
| < 150 | Normal |
| 150‚Äì199 | Borderline high |
| 200‚Äì499 | High |
| ‚â• 500 | Very high |

**Non-HDL Cholesterol** = TC ‚àí HDL (goal often **< 130 mg/dL** for many; lower for higher-risk individuals)  
**TC/HDL Ratio** ‚Äî Lower is generally better (often **< 5**; optimal targets vary)

*Always review results with a qualified healthcare provider.*
