## What This Test Measures
This panel measures IgE antibodies associated with allergic reactions to 15 common food allergens, such as:
- Milk
- Egg white
- Peanut
- Soybean
- Wheat
- Tree nuts (e.g., almond, cashew, walnut)
- Fish (e.g., cod)
- Shellfish (e.g., shrimp)

If a specific allergen tests positive, reflex testing is automatically performed to identify specific protein components within that allergen, helping to clarify cross-reactivity risk and reaction severity.

## Why Take This Test / Who Should Take It
You may benefit from this test if you:
- Have had suspected allergic reactions to foods
- Experience unexplained hives, swelling, digestive symptoms, or respiratory distress after eating
- Want to clarify which specific foods may trigger allergic responses
- Have a family history of food allergies

---

## How to Prepare
- No fasting required  
- Continue medications unless otherwise instructed by your provider  
- If you are currently experiencing an acute allergic reaction, testing should be delayed until resolved

## How It Works
1. **Order Online** â€” Purchase securely  
2. **Visit a Lab** â€” Provide your blood sample at a Quest Diagnostics location  
3. **Get Results** â€” Doctor-reviewed results in 5â€“7 business days, including component breakdown if positive

---

## Understanding Your Results
- **Negative IgE** â€” No evidence of sensitization to tested foods  
- **Positive IgE** â€” Suggests sensitization; clinical history is essential to confirm allergy  
- **Reflex Component Results** â€” May help identify high-risk allergens and guide dietary or treatment decisions

*Note: IgE testing does not measure severity of reaction; results should be interpreted with clinical history.*

## FAQ (Schema-Ready)
**Do I need to fast for this test?**  
No fasting is required.

**Can IgE levels change over time?**  
Yes â€” sensitization can develop or resolve; repeat testing may be appropriate.

**What is reflex component testing?**  
It identifies specific allergen proteins to clarify cross-reactivity and reaction potential.

**Does a positive result mean I have a food allergy?**  
Not necessarily â€” it indicates sensitization, which must be confirmed through history or additional testing.
