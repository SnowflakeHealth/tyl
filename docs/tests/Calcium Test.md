## What This Test Measures
The Calcium Test measures the amount of calcium in your blood.  
- **Calcium** is vital for strong bones and teeth, muscle contraction, nerve signaling, and blood clotting.  
- Most calcium is stored in bones, but blood levels must remain within a narrow range for normal function.
