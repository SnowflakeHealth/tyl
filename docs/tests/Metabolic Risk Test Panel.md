## What This Test Measures
The Metabolic Risk Test Panel combines a set of tests that evaluate your risk for metabolic syndrome â€” a cluster of conditions that increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. It typically includes:
- **Fasting Glucose** â€” Blood sugar control
- **Lipid Panel** â€” Total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and triglycerides
- **hs-CRP** â€” Inflammation marker linked to cardiovascular risk
- **Insulin** â€” Assesses insulin sensitivity
- **Other markers** â€” May include apolipoproteins or advanced lipid subfractions depending on the lab

- Have multiple cardiovascular risk factors
- Are overweight or have a large waist circumference
- Have high blood pressure, high blood sugar, or abnormal cholesterol
