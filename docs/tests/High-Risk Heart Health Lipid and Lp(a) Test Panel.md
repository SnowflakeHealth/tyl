## Quick Facts
| **Test Type**         | Blood test |
|----------------------|------------|
| **Fasting Required** | Yes (8–12 hours) |
| **Sample Type**      | Blood draw |
| **Turnaround Time**  | 3–5 business days |
| **Also Known As**    | Lipid Panel with Lipoprotein(a), Advanced Lipid & Lp(a) Panel |

## What This Test Measures
This panel includes:
- **Total Cholesterol**
- **LDL Cholesterol** — “Bad” cholesterol
- **HDL Cholesterol** — “Good” cholesterol
- **Triglycerides**
- **Non-HDL Cholesterol** — All potentially harmful cholesterol combined
- **Lipoprotein(a)** — A genetic risk factor for atherosclerosis and heart attacks

Lp(a) levels are largely inherited and not significantly affected by diet or exercise, making testing important for those with family history of heart disease.

---

## Why Take This Test / Who Should Take It
You may benefit from this test if you:
- Have a personal or family history of premature heart disease or stroke
- Have normal standard cholesterol results but high cardiovascular risk
- Have been diagnosed with high cholesterol that doesn’t respond as expected to treatment
- Want to evaluate inherited lipid risk factors

---

## How to Prepare
- Fast for 8–12 hours before your appointment (water only)  
- Avoid alcohol and high-fat meals for 24 hours before testing  
- Follow your provider’s advice on medications

## Understanding Your Results
- **Total, LDL, HDL, Triglycerides** — Standard lipid profile interpretation  
- **Non-HDL Cholesterol** — Goal often < 130 mg/dL; lower for high-risk individuals  
- **Lp(a)** — Higher levels increase cardiovascular and stroke risk, especially with other risk factors

*Note: Lp(a) is expressed in either mg/dL or nmol/L; ranges vary by lab.*

Often ordered with:
- [Apolipoprotein B] — Measures atherogenic particle number  
- [hs-CRP] — Detects inflammation related to heart disease  
- [Advanced Heart Health Test Panel (with ApoB)] — Broader lipid risk evaluation

Alternative tests:
- [Cholesterol (Lipid) Panel] — Standard lipid profile without Lp(a)  
- [Lipoprotein(a) Test] — Single biomarker focus

## FAQ (Schema-Ready)
**Do I need to fast for this test?**  
Yes, fasting for 8–12 hours is recommended.

**What is Lp(a)?**  
A lipoprotein particle similar to LDL, but with an attached protein called apolipoprotein(a) that increases cardiovascular risk.

**Can I lower my Lp(a) level?**  
There are currently no widely available medications proven to significantly lower Lp(a), but clinical trials are ongoing.

**Who should get tested for Lp(a)?**  
People with a family history of premature heart disease, stroke, or unexplained high cholesterol.
