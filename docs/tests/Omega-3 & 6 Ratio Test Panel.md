## What This Test Measures
The Omega-3 & 6 Ratio Test Panel measures the percentage of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids in your blood and calculates their ratio.  
- **Omega-3 fatty acids** (EPA, DHA, ALA) â€” Support heart, brain, and eye health; help reduce inflammation  
- **Omega-6 fatty acids** (LA, AA) â€” Essential for health but can promote inflammation if too high relative to omega-3s

An optimal omega-3 to omega-6 ratio is linked to reduced cardiovascular risk, better inflammatory balance, and improved cognitive function.
