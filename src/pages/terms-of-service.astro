      <p>
        I understand that Telehealth is a mode of delivering health care services via communication technologies (e.g., internet or cellphone) to facilitate diagnosis, consultation, treatment, education, care management, and self-management of a patient's health care.
      </p>

I understand that either my Telehealth provider or I can discontinue the Telehealth appointment if the technical connections are not adequate for my visit.
        </li>
        <li>

          I understand that I am responsible for payment of any amounts due and owing resulting from my Telehealth visit.
        </li>
        <li>
          In an emergent situation, I understand that the responsibility of my Telehealth provider may be to direct me to emergency medical services, such as an emergency room.
